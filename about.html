                <h3>Brandon M. Stewart</h3>
                <p>
                    Born in Yuma, AZ, I felt a strong call to serve my country, which led me to join the Marine Corps at 18 years old. 
                    During my eight years of service as an Avionics Technician, I proudly bore the title of United States Marine and embraced various roles that showcased 
                    my versatility and dedication. Whether serving as a Training and Operations NCO, Quality Assurance Representative, or Work Center Supervisor, I always strove 
                    to be the best Marine I could be, focusing equally on the wellbeing of my fellow Marines and the mission at hand.

                    <br>
                    <br>

                    After completing my service, I pursued my passion for technology by earning a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from SUNY New Paltz in 2024.
                     My time at SUNY New Paltz was marked by an enriching internship at the United States Military Academy at West Point, where I worked as an IT Support Specialist. 
                     This opportunity allowed me to further develop my technical skills and reinforced my enthusiasm for a career in technology. 
                     I am eager to see where this path will take me and am excited about the future possibilities in the tech industry.
