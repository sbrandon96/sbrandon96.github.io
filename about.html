                <h3>Brandon M. Stewart</h3>
                <p>
                    Born in Yuma, AZ, I left home and joined the Marine Corps at 18 years old. I had always felt a call to serve my country, and had the immense privilege 
                    to bear the title of United States Marine. I served for 8 years as an Avionics Technician by trade, and wore many hats during my time in the Marine Corps. 
                    Whether a training and operations NCO, a quality assurance representative, or a work center supervisor, I always strived to be the best Marine I could be. 
                    More than that, I always placed focus on the wellbeing of my Marines, and then the mission at hand.

                    After my time in the Marine Corps, I decided to pursue a degree in Computer Science. I graduated from SUNY New Paltz in 2024 with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science.
                    During my time at SUNY New Paltz, I was honored to allowed an internship with the United States Military Academy at West Point, NY, where I worked as an IT Specialist. 
                    I have always had a passion for technology, and I am excited to see where my career in tech will take me.
