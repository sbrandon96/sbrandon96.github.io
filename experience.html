                <h2>Computer Science</h2>
                <p class="experience">
                    Computer Science is a dynamic and rapidly evolving field that encompasses a wide range of topics and
                    skills.
                    During my studies, I have gained experience in the following areas:
                </p>
                <h3>Software Development</h3>
                <p class="experience">
                    <img class="in-line-image2" src="/assets/agile.png" alt="agile">
                    Software development is a critical component of Computer Science, involving the planning and
                    creation of software applications.
                    I was first exposed to software development techniques while pursuing my degree, including defining
                    requirements, creating UML
                    diagrams, and developing
                    software architecture. This is where I learned the vital importance of documentation and accurate
                    development reporting.
                    As for development practices, I have a personal interest in the Agile methodology and have been
                    personally
                    studying these fundamentals,
                    as they align directly with my philosophy regarding software development, efficiency, and
                    collaboration.
                </p>
                <h3>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)</h3>
                <p class="experience">
                    <img class="in-line-image" src="/assets/OOP.png" alt="OOP">
                    Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects," which can
                    contain data and code to manipulate that data.
                    I have experience in object-oriented programming languages like Java and Python, and have used OOP
                    principles to design software. I prefer this approach
                    to programming as it allows for more modular, maintainable, and scalable code. It is also easy for
                    outside developers to understand and work with.

                    Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on the development of
                    algorithms that allow computers to learn from and make predictions based on data.
                    I have experience in deploying machine learning algorithms for tasks such as statistical analysis,
                    pattern recognition, and predictive modeling. Using python and libraries like
                    Scikit-learn, I have been able to develop and deploy machine learning models. For more information

                <h2>Avionics</h2>
                <p>
                    Avionics is a field that combines aviation and electronics to create aircraft systems that provide
                    critical information to pilots and crew.
                    During my time in the Marine Corps, I worked as an Avionics Technician, where I gained experience in
                    the following areas:
                </p>
                <h3>Electrical Systems</h3>

                    Avionics systems rely on complex electrical systems to function properly. I have experience in
                    troubleshooting and repairing electrical systems
                    on aircraft, including wiring, connectors, and power distribution systems. I have a strong
                    understanding of electrical theory and have applied
                    this knowledge to maintain avionics systems in optimal condition.

                    Communication systems are essential for safe and efficient flight operations. I have experience in
                    maintaining and repairing communication systems
                    on aircraft, including radios, antennas, and transponders. My specialty was in the repair and 
                    maintence of the Reconfigurable Transportable Consolidated Automated Support System (RTCASS) which is a
                    system that tests and calibrates avionics systems. This computer has its own RF system embedded in it, which allowed me 
                    to gain a deeper understanding of RF systems.
                    I have worked with a variety of
                    communication technologies and have a strong understanding
                    of how these systems operate.

                <p>
                    Production management is the process of planning, organizing, and controlling the production of
                    goods and services.
                    During my time in the Marine Corps, I gained experience in production management through the
                    following areas:

                    including inspecting and testing aircraft components
                    to ensure they meet safety and performance requirements. During my time in the Marine Corps, I obtained the 
                    qualification of Collateral Duty Inspector (CDI) which allowed me to inspect and sign off on aircraft maintenance.
                    During my career, I never had a discrepancy on any inspection I performed.
                    I have a strong understanding of quality
                    control principles and have used this knowledge
