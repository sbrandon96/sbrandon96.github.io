                    Ever since my family got our first computer, I have been interested in technology. 
                    Be it hardware or software, I have always enjoyed learning about the latest advancements in the tech world.
                    As a hobby, I built and modified my own computer. This has helped me stay up to speed with the latest technology, and has given me a better understanding of how computers work.

                    I have always been interested in the world that existed before my time. It lead me to a deep interest in history, and I have always enjoyed learning about the past.
                    History provides the context necessary to understand the present, and it is fascinating to see how the world has changed over time. I particulary enjoy learning about
                    ancient history, and the rise and fall of empires.

                <p class="interests">Wisdom is obtained through seeking it out. I have enjoyed studying philosophy in my own life because it has informed me on how best to live. 
                    Philosophy is the study of the fundamental nature of knowledge, reality, and existence, especially when considered as an academic discipline. 
                    It is a subject that has been studied for thousands of years, and has been a major influence on the development of Western thought. My personal favorite philosopher is Cicero.

                    Perhaps an odd interest to have, I have always enjoyed the satisfaction of completing a repair on my own vehicle. 
                    It has led to becoming proficient in hand tools and diagnostic tools while saving money by doing my own repairs. 
                    Though I didnâ€™t start with a robust knowledge of vehicle maintenance in my youth, I pressed forward and tackled problems with my car as they arose. 
                    I probably turned some hairs gray with the annoyance of chasing down and odd problem with my car, I have gotten much experience from the struggle.
